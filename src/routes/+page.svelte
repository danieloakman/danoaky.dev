			<p>
				I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a passion for building robust fullstack web and mobile
				applications that deliver real impact. My expertise lies in crafting scalable solutions,
				from developing engaging React Native mobile experiences to architecting server-side
				rendered Next.js web apps and microservices. I thrive on tackling complex challenges,
				optimizing performance for large user bases, and ensuring seamless integration across
				diverse platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to a wide range of
				environments, from dynamic startups to established corporations. I've led teams, mentored
				junior developers, and provided strategic technical guidance, always with an eye toward
				efficiency, maintainability, and user-centric design. You'll find my work touches on
				everything from video streaming optimization and AI-driven content generation to
				containerization and advanced backend architectures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of coding, I enjoy photography, playing video games, snowboarding, rock climbing and spending time with my wonderful wife and dog.
